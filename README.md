# DHT11-library-for-STM32
A simple library for retrieving temperature and humidity data from DHT11 sensor using STM32 boards.
\nJust make the connections correctly and it is good to go.
\nI have tried to put together all of the information I could find about retrieving data from DHT11. 
\nTo understand what is going on, inspecting the code in parallel with DTH datasheet is advised. (link: https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/758/DHT11-Technical-Data-Sheet-Translated-Version-1143054.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOorhfNEUMbCnwzGsxVz2ill042i1VkaypPnbJUDAh00Q7Rfukql8)
\nPlease pay attention to comment sections on both .h and .c files.
