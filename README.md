# DHT11-library-for-STM32
A simple library for retrieving temperature and humidity data from DHT11 sensor using STM32 boards.
Just make the connections correctly and it is good to go.
I have tried to put together all of the information I could find about retrieving data from DHT11. 
To understand what is going on, inspecting the code in parallel with DTH datasheet is advised. (link: https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/758/DHT11-Technical-Data-Sheet-Translated-Version-1143054.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOorhfNEUMbCnwzGsxVz2ill042i1VkaypPnbJUDAh00Q7Rfukql8)
Please pay attention to comment sections on both .h and .c files.
